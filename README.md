# Homework-Typescript-Generics-Decorators

1.
Create a map using TypeScript Generics. The key is always a string.

The value can be a string or a number. It has to work with both types.

It's got to have the following methods:

Creating a new key-value pair : setItem(key: string, item: T)

Retrieving values : getItem(key: string)

Remove all items : clear()

Display all key-value items : printMap().

2. 
Create a "log" decorator function that will be attached to the method and will log function name and parameters.
